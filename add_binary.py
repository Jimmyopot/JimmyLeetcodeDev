HOW BINARY SYSTEM WORKS:

- Each position in a num rep a certain value/binary.
- For every num, the position rep BASE 10, eg. 237

2 1 0 -> power of....
2 3 7
(10^2 * 2) + (10^1 * 3) + (10^0 * 7) = 237
    200           30            7
    
    
- For binary digits, the position rep BASE 2, eg. 111

2 1 0 -> power of....
1 1 1
(2^2 * 1) + (2^1 * 1) + (2^0 * 1) = 6
    4            2           0
