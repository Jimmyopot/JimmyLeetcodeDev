- All about RECURSION => REPETITION! 
- Pattern based, eg, Fibonacci sequence.
- Find a recursive soln, are there repeated states in it?, and store them in a matrix.
  1. Recursion.
  2. Store (Memoize).
  3. Bottom-up.
- You see trends in the soln.
- eg, Fibonacci sequence:
  1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
  (1+1=2), (1+2=3), (2+3=5), (3+5=8), (5+8=13)
